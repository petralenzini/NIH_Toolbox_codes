#open one of the folders that the NDA sent and find the file that contains the list of vars in
#your file and the list of vars in the NDA as one-to-one pairs
#for example, we have files with the column headers "NDA Element" and "HCP-D Element"
#we also have files with the column headers "NDA Element" and "HCP-A Element"
#provide the name of local variable:
localvar="HCP-D Element"

# get list of files and folders in the inout directory
# The string containing the name of the new folders from the NDA will be assigned to
# variable called 'Instrument_Short' because after filtering out all the other
# files/folders (list1 and list2 below) thats what you'll have:
# the NDAs shorthand name for the NIH Toolbox Instrument
dirs=pd.DataFrame(os.listdir(inout),columns=['Instrument_Short'])

# as something to be added to a crosswalk
list1=['zip','csv','xlsx','pptx'] #file extensions in this folder of folders from Leo that you want to ignore
list2=['drafts','HCPD','temp','added_tocrosswalk','dummypass','almost trash','prepped_structures'] #identify folders you want to ignore

# for the items not in list1 or list2, read the folder contents and turn them into something appendable/mergeable
# four possible files:
# Mapping Key has the Full Name of the NDA structure to which this stuff will be mapped, the short name,
# and the name on the Form as we will be uploading it (Inst)
# One file in this folder has an Instrument_short.structure name format
# Occasionally you'll get a formRequest file which will contains NDA verbal instructions that
# ultimately need to be translated into executable python code (more on this later).
# The template file is not used in the crosswalk, but may come in handy for debugging (i.e. if someone
# on either end of this process accidentally assigned the wrong aliases).
